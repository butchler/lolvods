###Semi-spoiler free League of Legends VODs

Website generator that pulls data from the League of Legends ESports website's
(undocumented) APIs to genearate a site that lists the most recent pro League
games in the past two weeks, but doesn't show who won the game so that you can
watch the game without knowing who won in advance.

However, the site lists stats about the games such as number of kills for each
team, so that you can see how close the games were and decide what to watch.

update-divshot.js is a script that pulls data from the LOL ESports APIs,
generates the HTML, storing it in the app/ folder, and uploads the generated
site to the divshot.io static site service, at [lolvods.divshot.io](http://lolvods.divshot.io).
